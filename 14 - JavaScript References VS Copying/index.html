    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Jay';
    console.log(players, team2);


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'David';
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Hannah';
    console.log(players, team4);

    // or old school ... Array.from
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Luke';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Jay Barr',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(person, captain); // uh-oh, both ages changed!!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const co_captain = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 100, number: 1});
    console.log(person, co_captain);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const first_mate = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.

    dev.social.twitter = '@awesomedude';
    console.log(jay.social, dev.social);

    // oh-no!! They both changed! Since anything more than 1 level deep will be passed by reference rather than by value. What to do?

    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it since maybe there's a better way and you can save adding a whole library of bloat to your program

    // poor man's deep clone - but performance may be an issue!
